Perhaps somewhat unconventional, the start of my programming journey came during a time in which I was buying and selling streetwear trainers. Struggling to secure stock against buyers who were using bots, I became aware of the need to keep up with developments in the streetwear market and started writing my own scripts. This was the moment in which the power of programming revealed itself to me.",
        paragraph2: "After dabbling in botting for a while, I started to hone my programming skills, ending up making multiple apps and websites. Ranging from a warehouse admin app with Kivy and Python to a maths game built with Swift, and even a multiple eCommerce site built with Django, my work has proven varied and difficult in equal measure. Committed to keeping sharp, I relish challneges that require learning new skills."

        paragraph1: "I have been a self taught programer since 2016, creating many different projects on the way to be where I am at now. Funnily enough my programming start was very unconventional as I had started buying and selling shoes at the time and I had realised that instead of using my own energy to wait up for shoes I can write scripts to do the whole thing for me this was when I realised how much power was in programming.",
        paragraph2: "After dabbling in botting for a while I started to hone my programming skills in which I ended up making multiple apps and websites such as a warehouse admin app with kivy and python or a maths game built with swift or multiple ecommerce sites built with django. I always try to keep building different things to keep my mind sharp and fresh"
